__________________________________________________________

The JSSys3.dll component is designed to provide system information and functions that
are not available in VBScript. The included HTML file contains a thorough listing
of all functions. Most functions are also demonstrated with the sample scripts.
Open the scripts in Notepad to see explanations in the comments at top.
  (Note: Some of the samples require that a file be on the Desktop before running.)

 
DEPENDENCIES: 
    Use of this component requires:
    *  the VB6 Runtime Files

REGISTERING COMPONENTS:
    ******************************************************************
    ******************************************************************
    *     NOTE: If you registered version 1 or 2 of JSSys.dll it should be unregistered,        *
    *     replaced with this version, then the new version should be registered. This          *
    *     version contains some changes to existing functions.                                       *
    *    (RegSvr.vbs can be used for both operations.)                                                 *

    The component must be "registered" in Windows before use.
            You can use the VBScript RegSvr.vbs to register or un-register any component.
             The script also contains tips (commented) for registering a component remotely.
          --------------------------------

            To register JSSys3.dll by hand:
              Go to Start Menu/Run.
              Enter:
                 RegSvr32 C:\Windows\System\JSSys3.dll
                   (one space after "32". 2nd part should be path to where you've put JSSys3.dll.)
              Click OK.
               You should see a message box confirming that the component has been registered.
            
            To unregister the component:
                  RegSvr32 -U C:\Windows\System\JSSys3.dll
            
            These operations require that you have RegSvr32.exe on your computer.
            
TO USE THE COMPONENT IN VBSCRIPT:
 There are 3 objects in JSSys3.dll: Ops, IniEdit and StreamOps
________________________________________________________________  
Ops OBJECT:
        
           Dim ObjVar 
           Set ObjVar = CreateObject("JSSys3.Ops")

IniEdit OBJECT
  
           Dim ObjVar 
           Set ObjVar = CreateObject("JSSys3.IniEdit")
